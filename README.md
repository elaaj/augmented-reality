## Requirements

This repository contains the source code for Assignment 3 of Geometric and 3D Computer Vision course. It aims at performing an augmented reality by 
using marker point coordinates detected in the previous assignment, repository [Inserire repo nome 2 Assignment], to compute marker pose and project 
a virtual cube on top of a rotating object using augmented reality techniques. 

## Description:

The **main.ipynb** jupyter notebook contains the code to track objects in a video, extract camera pose, and overlay a 3D cube on the object in each frame of the video. The *intrinsic parameters K* and the *distortion coefficients* are already provided: 
- *K*:
